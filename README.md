# ZooKeepr

## Description

This project was an activity using express.js to create a server and backend functionality and link it to a front end note-taker application.  The goal of this project was to generate the back-end of a zoo website where the user could view, add, update, delete animals and zookeepers working at the zoo. 

This project helped me understand how the back end is linked to the front through a series of GET and POST functions within the backend structure as well as FETCH structures in the front end javascript.  I learned how to require express, as well as modularize the code to make it easier to read.

## Installation


If the user already has node installed on their device, they can download this project and run "npm init" and then "npm i express" to download the express dependecy.  If they are interested in running the tests, enter "npm i --save-dev jest".  Next, the user should enter "npm start" to launch the server and then view the website at localhost:3001.

## Usage

When the user navigates to the server's page (localhost:3001), they will be presented with a title page where they are given a brief description of the website, the ability to see animals and zookeepers, and able to enter new animals and zookeepers.
